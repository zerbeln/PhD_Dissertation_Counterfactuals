This repository contains code for the AADI Lab rover domain. Code is currently implemented in python.
A primitive rover domain visualizer is implemented alongside the rover domain code.

To run classic rover domain (tightly coupled or loosely coupled) use run_standard.py

To train rover suggestions use main.py

Test and visualize trained classic rover policies: run_visualizer.py

Test and visualize suggestions with trained policies: test_suggestions.py

Create and train playbook of rover policies for suggestions: run_policy_bank.py
